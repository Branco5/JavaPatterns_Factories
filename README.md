Scientific publications contain a *bibliography* section/chapter. This refers to
other works that support the research or thesis. Each entry is called a **citation**.

There are different types of publications, e.g., books, chapters of books, journal articles. etc.

There are also different *citation styles*, e.g., IEEE, APA, Chicago, etc. This relates
to how the citations are formatted in bibliography. Publishers require
different citation styles. For example, publications on engineering, computer science and information technology may use 
the IEEE citation style. Natural sciences may use the APA style.

Below are examples of the IEEE citation style for three different types of publications:

Type | In-text citation | Formatted Citation
